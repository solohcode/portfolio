    aboutme: <div>
                <p>I'm Solomon Ayodele, an experienced software engineer from Lagos, Nigeria. I go by the online alias "solohcode". I have been writing programs for more than six years now, I have been able to build, deploy, and maintain responsive, fully functional web apps for more than five years, and I have worked as a professional software engineer for over four years for up to four distinct firms.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Over the years, I have developed experience in the use of major technologies the likes of JAVASCRIPT, and TYPESCRIPT. libraries like REACTJS, NEXTJS, and VUEJS. state management tools like REDUX and RECOIL. CSS libraries like TAILWIND, BOOTSTRAP, and SCSS. UI/UX design tools like WIREFRAME and FIGMA. project management tools like GIT and GitHub. Task management programs like CLICKUP, ASANA, TRELLO, and other frontend-related libraries are just a few examples. I've also worked with backend programs like FIREBASE, PHP, and MySQL, and still eager to explore more around the tech world.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>I am a technology geek who enjoys discussing everything tech-related, and so far, problem-solving has been my best topic. a confident proponent of technical evolution, a propagandist for individual and social growth, a student with high learning interest, and a physical and technical deep thinker.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>I will proudly refer to myself as an individual who is very much devoted to his trade because throughout the years I have been able to master various important physiological and technical qualities. a strong communicator, vivacious team player, and growth-conscious team lead, I have had remarkable project management and team-leading experiences throughout my career in the sector.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>My passions are more concerned with problem-solving, mind and body growth, travel, and global discovery than my hobbies, which include things like computing, cuisine, listening to music, playing video games, and leisure sports.</p>
